## Description
A simple game created as a code alomg challenge with [Dr. Joshua Bastean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FD_A9P87Ek&list=PLQSmIhc0GVPPhpBAC3y6xChtOz3RJ8abN&index=88). The aim of the game is to guess which color among the tiles matches the indicated RGB values. It has 2 levels of difficulty: 3 tiles for easy and 6 tiles for hard.
	
This was the first project that helped me understand how JavaScript works with HTML and the DOM and gave me the basic knowledge needed for me to create several projects in the future.

## Technologies Used
- CSS
- JavaScript
- HTML
## Expected Features
- Header for the RGB value to be guessed. The RGB value is generated randomly using a bunch of Math.random() values for r, g and b.
- An area to reset the colors given and choose the level of difficulty.
- An area for the tiles of random colors to choose from.
- Change interface colors to the given RGB value if the chosen tile is correct.
- Remove a chosen tile if the answer is wrong.
- Ability to reset the colors to generate a new game.

## Things I Learned While Building This Project
- Better understanding of the DOM
- Finally understanding how JavaScript relates to HTML, CSS and DOM.
- To generate a numbers based on a specific range, you have to use Math.random() multiplied by the ceiling of chosen number range
- increased CSS and JavaScript knowledge
